## ðŸ§  Architectural Decisions

- **MVC-ish Separation**:  
  Controllers manage state, models represent structured data, services handle API/Firebase logic.

- **Modular Structure**:  
  Code is organized by responsibility: UI, data, logic, and routing are in distinct folders.

- **Dependency Injection**:  
  `bindings/` handles controller injection to reduce tight coupling.
